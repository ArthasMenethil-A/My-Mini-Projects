# LIST OF PROJECTS
 - **pong game using** (arduino, python): 
   This project is about making use of the MPU-6050 sensor as a ping-pong racket in a python-generated pong-game. The segmentation is as explained below: 

   1. Chapter 0: INTRODUCTION
      - Sensors: MPU-6050 and MPU-9250
      - Methods of extracting data 
      - Calibration 
      - Kalman and Complementary filters
      - Processing data with Python 
      - Game Design with Python 
   2. Chapter 1: DATA EXTRACTION
      - Setup of the Arduino kit
      - Data extraction 
      - Plotting the data
   3. Chapter 2: FILTERS
      - Kalman filter on raw data
      - Complementary filter
   4. Chapter 3: DATA PROCESSING
      - Rotation matrix (from roll, pitch yaw)
      - Rotation matrix (from quaternion values)
   5. Chapter 4: GAME DESIGN 
      - Making the game with Python 
      - MPU-6050 data to Game input
