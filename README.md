# LIST OF PROJECTS
 - **pong game using** (arduino, python): 
     This project is about making use of the MPU-6050 sensor as a ping-pong racket in a python-generated pong-game. 
     The segmentation is as explained below: 
         Chapter 0: INTRODUCTION
            - Sensors: MPU-6050 and MPU-9250
            - Methods of extracting data 
            - Calibration 
            - Kalman and Complementary filters
            - Processing data with Python 
            - Game Design with Python 
         Chapter 1: DATA EXTRACTION
            - Setup of the Arduino kit
            - Data extraction 
            - Plotting the data
         Chapter 2: FILTERS
             - Kalman filter on raw data
             - Complementary filter
         Chapter 3: DATA PROCESSING
             - Rotation matrix (from roll, pitch yaw)
